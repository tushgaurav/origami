# Origami

A hackable, self-hosted and modern start page for your homelab—fast, minimal, and built to customize.

### Motivation

After years of running a homelab and overlooking the value of a clean landing page, I finally set out to build my own. While there are plenty of existing projects, I wanted something modern, customizable, and visually appealing—many alternatives feel dated or lack flexibility. So I created Origami: a start page designed for today's homelabbers, focused on speed, minimalism, and easy customization.
