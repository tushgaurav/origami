# Origami

A hackable, self-hosted and modern start page for your homelabâ€”fast, minimal, and built to customize.

## Motivation

I am deep into the homelab stuff and after neglecting having a proper landing page for my homelab, I am finally making one myself. But why make one when there are tons of similar projects? Well most of them look kind of ugly and are build on top of older technologies, so i build my own project.
